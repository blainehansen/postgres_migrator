# `postgres_migrator`

`postgres_migrator` allows you to write your postgres schema directly in *declarative sql*, to automatically generate migrations when you change that declarative schema, and to apply those migrations with rigorous version tracking and consistency checks.

**No more orms!** Use the full power of postgres directly without having to manually write migrations.

`postgres_migrator` is able to:

- Automatically generate raw sql migrations by diffing the sql in a migrations folder to that in a schema folder.
- Apply those migrations and save migration version numbers in the database, so you can know what state a database is supposed to be in.
- Run consistency checks on migrations, so that they are only ever applied in the order they were generated. This can prevent very painful debugging and database corruption.

`postgres_migrator` intentionally doesn't do the following:

- Create "down" versions of migrations. If you want to undo something in production, just make a new migration (that's best practice anyway). In dev just force the database into the right state.
- Allow running migrations only up to a certain version. `postgres_migrator` will always apply all available unapplied migrations. If you don't want to apply some migrations, move them to a different folder or change their extension to something other than `.sql`.
- Figure out database diffs itself, but instead uses the well-establised [`migra`](https://github.com/djrobstep/migra) under the hood.

## SSL/TLS Support

`postgres_migrator` automatically handles SSL connections, attempting SSL first (matching PostgreSQL's default behavior), then falling back to non-SSL if needed. Self-signed certificates are accepted for compatibility with cloud providers.

# Example

If your `schema` directory contains a sql file like this:

```sql
create table fruit (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null unique,
  color text not null default ''
);
```

Then running `postgres_migrator generate 'add fruit table'` will generate a migration called `$new_version.$previous_version.add_fruit_table.sql` in the `migrations` folder.

You can then run `postgres_migrator migrate` to run this migration (and any others that haven't been run).

If you then change your schema sql to this:

```sql
create type flavor_type as enum('SWEET', 'SAVORY');

create table fruit (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null unique,
  flavor flavor_type not null default 'SWEET'
);
```

Then running `postgres_migrator generate 'remove color add flavor'` will generate `$new_version.$previous_version.remove_color_add_flavor.sql` that will go from the previous state to the new state.

# Usage

First, place your declarative sql files in the `schema` directory and create a directory for migrations called `migrations`. You can customize these with `--schema-directory` and `--migrations-directory`.

You can put any valid sql in the `migrations` files, you don't have to accept the automatically generated sql as is. All this tool cares about is the difference between the final sql objects created by sql in the `schema` and `migrations` directories, [and however you achieve that is up to you!](https://github.com/blainehansen/postgres_migrator/issues/4)

## As a standalone docker image

`postgres_migrator` is distributed as a docker image, `blainehansen/postgres_migrator`. You can run it using `docker run`, and since the cli needs to interact with a postgres database, read schema files, and read/write migration files, it needs quite a few options:


```bash
docker run --rm -it --network host -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v $(pwd):/working blainehansen/postgres_migrator <args>
```

To make this easier to manage, you can package that command in a function, alias, or script:

```bash
function postgres_migrator {
  local result=$(docker run --rm -it --network host -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v $(pwd):/working -e PG_URL=$PG_URL blainehansen/postgres_migrator "$@")
  echo $result
  return $?
}

# or
alias postgres_migrator="docker run --rm -it --network host -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v $(pwd):/working -e PG_URL=$PG_URL blainehansen/postgres_migrator"

# or in it's own executable file
docker run --rm -it --network host -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v $(pwd):/working -e PG_URL=$PG_URL blainehansen/postgres_migrator "$@"

# now you can call it more cleanly
postgres_migrator generate 'adding users table'
postgres_migrator migrate
```

## With docker compose

Many people run postgres as one service in a docker compose setup, either using a `postgres` image or something like `cloud-sql-proxy`.

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  postgres_migrator:
    image: blainehansen/postgres_migrator
    container_name: postgres_migrator
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - PG_URL=postgres://experiment_user:asdf@db:5432/experiment_db?sslmode=disable
    volumes:
      - .:/working/
    tty: true
    entrypoint: tail -F anything

  db:
    image: postgres:alpine
    container_name: db
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=experiment_db
      - POSTGRES_USER=experiment_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=asdf
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    command: postgres -c 'max_wal_size=2GB'
```

If that is running, a command like this should work:

```sh
docker exec -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) postgres_migrator postgres_migrator migrate
```

## As a Rust binary

This package is published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/postgres_migrator), so you can use `cargo install postgres_migrator` to install it.

The package calls the [`migra`](https://github.com/djrobstep/migra) command, so that must be installed and runnable.

## How to use with an existing database?

If you already have a database with an existing schema, you need to generate your first migration using the `--is-onboard` flag:

```bash
postgres_migrator generate 'first migration with postgres_migrator' --is-onboard
# migrations folder should have migration named `$new_version.onboard.first_migration_with_postgres_migrator.sql`
```

The `--is-onboard` flag changes the first migration to be an "onboarding" migration. When this migration is run, the actual sql in the migration won't be applied, and instead `postgres_migrator` will just create the `_schema_versions` table and insert the version of the migration.

After you've created this first "onboarding" migration, and can just use `postgres_migrator` as usual!

## What is `compact`?

Over time a migrations folder can get large and unwieldy, with possibly hundreds of migrations. This long log gets less and less useful over time, especially for small teams. The `compact` command replaces all migrations with a single migration that creates the entire schema at once.

Some teams will consider this dangerous and unnecessary, and they're free to not use it!

# Credits

- [`migra`](https://github.com/djrobstep/migra) for making it possible to diff schemas.
- [`tusker`](https://github.com/bikeshedder/tusker) was the inspiration for using temporary databases as diff targets. `postgres_migrator` adds the ability to generate and run versioned migrations and to perform compaction.
- Thank you [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for being so awesome! [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) and [rust-postgres](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres) in particular made this way easier.
